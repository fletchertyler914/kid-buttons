## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

A: Make sure you're using the Fabric profile, not vanilla Minecraft

**Q: Buttons don't work when I click them**
A: Check that you have operator permissions or are in single-player mode

**Q: I get stuck when using the home button**
A: The mod uses safe teleportation - it will never teleport you to dangerous locations

**Q: The interface looks too big/small**
A: The interface automatically scales to your screen size
